This Python script utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to provide users with real-time weather information for a specified city. Users are prompted to input the city name, after which the script fetches and displays the current weather conditions, including the weather type and temperature in Fahrenheit.

To use the script, users need to obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap and insert it into the api_key variable. The script then sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for the specified city.

If the city is not found or if there are any issues with the API request, appropriate error messages are displayed.

This simple yet effective script offers a quick way to check the weather for any city, making it useful for personal or educational purposes. It serves as a beginner-friendly example of API integration and data fetching in Python.
